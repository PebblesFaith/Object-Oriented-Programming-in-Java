My re-written lecture for Module 1, Meet Arrays hyperlink:  

Up until now, you have Java programmed, your Data Types, Primitive and Object, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable that is call using a Constructor keyword, such as new followed by the semantic value or value type to a specified length in number, such as [3] of a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic. In an auto-initialization or initialized to the zero-equivalent call, “no object” which is  reference to your semantic value or value type; in order for you to execute or run an Array Constructor. Now, you can store, your Array variable value[s] to a specific reference  semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing which allows flexibilities when you are Java coding in a For Loops or Traversal Algorithms. And, if you are Java coding an Algorithms that does not develop into a more programmatic complexities in Java language from your Procedural Decompositions, Flow of Controls, and Control Structures in a Computer Science Abstractions than you have Java coded more Array variables than you can manage, in your Java File programs.

Let us start with an example shown below.  And, let us assume, you have written, your Java Array Constructor that allows an end-user to input his or her homework assignment scores onto your Object Data Type, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable name, input that is call using a Constructor keyword, such as new followed by the Object’s semantic value or value type then passes an end-user input information about his or her source to your Java parameter, System.in imported library; in order for your end-user to read from his or her console window.
Please keep in mind, the end-user is allowed to enter seven (7) homework assignment scores, as an input onto your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1). And, after, he or she had entered his or her seven (7) homework assignment scores onto your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1) then your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1) codes will calculate the interactive end-user overall homework assignment average score, as follows:


























And, you already know, how to write your Java language programmatic Object Data Type, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable; in order to create a new Constructor from your previous Primitives vs Objects lessons.

In the above example, you have written, your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1); in order to For Loops a deterministic number of times and, the interactive end-user is allowed to enter his or her homework assignment scores seven (7) times onto your IntelliJ IDE Compiler until it reaches the seven (7) loop then the IntelliJ IDE Compiler will jump or move your Control Structures to the overall homework assignment score calculation statement (System.out.println("Average Homework Overall Score = " + (sum/7)); in order to provide your interactive end-user with his or her overall computed homework assignments score results. Simple right?

Well, what if, you are asked to write a Java language programmatic codes in which, the interactive end-user wanted to know, how many homework assignment scores were above average? This means, you will need to write your Java codes; in order to evaluate, your interactive end-user overall homework assignment scores which, compares his or her individual homework assignment score that is above average. However, in the above example, your Java language codes written does not allow, you to simply achieve auto-initializations using multiple semantic references or indexes or zero-based indexing that passes through a Constructor, Scanner in an Array variable name, i because a Scanner does not allow, you to see the data a second (2nd) time, as a “reset” option. Instead, you have programmatically coded, a prompt for your interactive end-user to enter in his or her homework assignment scores data then compute the cumulative sum in a For Loops or Traversal Algorithms; in order to fill up an Array that stores these interactive end-user’s homework assignment scores. Therefore, you have to Java language code only one (1) Array variable assigned to all homework assignment scores entered in by ways of an interactive end-user onto his or her IDE Compiler.  

In our next example, this is how you might solve, your multiple Data Type Object, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable, as a programmatic problem. And, your Java language codes are not the prettiest programmatic codes, as follows:













































As, you analyzes, your Java language codes, you have created numerous of separate variables for each individual homework assignment scores such as, an int hw1 = getHWScore(input, 1)  and so on; which, programmatically works in the above Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample2). What if, you were asked, to write a Java language programmatic codes for the above example for more than seven (7) homework assignment scores or what if, you were asked, to write a Java language programmatic codes for hundreds of homework assignment scores? Imagine,  yourself managing your written Java programmatic codes Array variables in the above example. These individuals Array variables would become your independent nightmares, in order for you to overcome. In additon, what if, you want to write, your Java language programmatic codes in order to provide your interactive end-user with more flexibility to enter onto his or her IDE Compiler, as many homework assignment scores, as he or she wanted to evaluate, as an overall score? This is not possible with the above example because the above example is too static or lack of your programmatic coding in Procedural Decompositions, Flow of Controls, and Control Structures logical algorithms. 

Thankfully, Java language has a Data Types, Primitive or Object’s Constructor Keywords to help, you solve both of these “What if” problems stated above.

Meet the Array.

Array is an indexed structure that holds multiple values of the same type. The values stored in an array are called elements. The individual elements are accessed using an integer index. 

Index is an integer indicating the position of a particular value in a data structure. 

An Array is a data structure that group together a collection of variables of the same type which, means an Array is a collection of the same type of variable all under one (1) objects or elements or values are semantic in a semantic value or value type.

In the below example, this is how, you might visualize an Array.

Index,
Zero-Based Indexing or
Reference Semantic	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
Object,
Element or
Value is Semantic
	12	49	-2	26	5	17	-6	84	72	3



As an analogy, consider a post office boxes. The boxes are indexed with numbers, element so, you can refer to an individual box by using a description such as, “P.O. Box 884.” You have already experience using an index to indicate positions within a String; do you remember Java language coding the method charAt and substring. Like String indexes, an array indexes start with zero (0). This is a convention known as, zero-based indexing.

Zero-Based Indexing is a numbering scheme used throughout Java language in which, a sequence of values is indexing starting with zero, 0 assigned to an element which, refers to an object in the above example is twelve (12) (element 0, element 1, element 2, and so on). 

A[n] Reference Semantics or Indexes or Zero-Based Indexing are a block of memory, in your Java language codes that are split up into an individual index section where you can store individual objects or elements or values are semantic into an Array [ ] variable. Therefore, in the above example, you have an Array of integers (int) known as, a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic for which, you can actually store in ten (10) separate integer (int)  all within the same Array [ ] variable name, x.

An Array [ ] is divided into two (2) parts. The Array [ ] first (1st) part is known as, a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic which is, the data itself or, Primitive or Object Data Types and, the second (2nd) part of an Array [ ]  is each object or element or value is semantic is given an assigned index number known as, a[n] reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing.  The reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number is a fixed address to where your object or element or value is semantic lives within the context of an Array [ ]. 

So, in the example below, if you write a Java language code to return the very first (1st) object or element or value is semantic in an Array [ ]. You will write, your programmatic Java language in order to return the object or element or value is semantic of twelve (12) at reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number of zero (0). And, an Array [ ].  starting at Zero-Based Indexing which, start counting at zero (0) Index.  Let us say, you wanted to return an object or element or value is semantic at reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number of four (4) which is, the fifth (5th) object or element or value is semantic; if, you are counting your index starting at zero (0) in an Array [ ]. However, your IDE Compiler knows exactly where to execute or run your index return for a[n] object or element or value is semantic of five (5) at reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number of four (4).  And, finally, if you wanted to return a[n] reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number of nine (9) which is, the tenth (10th) object or element or value is semantic; if, you are counting your index starting at zero (0) in an Array [ ] starting at one (1). So, you are returning a[n] object or element or value is semantic three (3) at reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing number of nine (9).  Therefore, when you are programmatically coding in Java language using an Array Constructor in Indexing or addressing a[n] object or element or value is semantic than you can find any reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing directly in the Array [ ]. 

index	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
element	12	49	-2	26	5	17	-6	84	72	3



                   Element at 0                                                          Element at 4                                                                         Element at 3

In the below example, is how you will create, your Array Constructor in Java language:

type [ ] name = new type[length]; or

<element type> [ ] <variable name> = <element type> [length];
