Sarai Hannah Ajai Preliminary Rewritten Lectuce Notes

Object Oriented Programming in Java (Microsoft Dev 277x)

Module 1 | Primitives vs Objects

Instructor Kasey Champion, Computer Science Curriculum Developer: 

My re-written lecture for Module 1, Meet Arrays hyperlink:  

Up until now, you have Java programmed, your Data Types, Primitive and Object, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable that is call using a Constructor keyword, such as new followed by the semantic value or value type to a specified length in number, such as [3] of a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic. In an auto-initialization or initialized to the zero-equivalent in your semantic value or value type call, “no object”; in order for you to Java code in an Array Constructor. Now, you can store, your Array variable value[s] to a specific reference semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing which allows flexibilities when you are Java coding in a For Loops or Traversal Algorithms. And, if you are Java coding an Algorithms that does not develop into a more programmatic complexities in Java language from your Procedural Decompositions, Flow of Controls, and Control Structures in a Computer Science Abstractions than you have Java coded more Array variables than you can manage, in your Java File programs.

Let us start with an example shown below.  And, let us assume, you have written, your Java Array Constructor that allows an end-user to input his or her homework assignment scores onto your Object Data Type, as a semantic value or value type which reference to an Array variable name, input that is call using a Constructor keyword, such as new followed by the Object’s semantic value or value type then passes an end-user input information about his or her source to your Java parameter, System.in imported library; in order for your end-user to read from his or her console window.
Please keep in mind, the end-user is allowed to enter seven (7) homework assignment scores, as an input onto your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1). And, after, he or she had entered his or her seven (7) homework assignment scores onto your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1) then your Java File Program (Module1MeetArraysOnlineLectureExample1) codes will calculate the interactive end-user overall homework assignment average score, as follows:
