Up until now, you should be very comfortable working with certain Data Types, Primitive and Object. And, you have probably noticed, the distinction between what is call Primitive and Object Data Types. So, lets us start with remembering exactly what a Primitive Data Types are:

A Primitive Data Types are the[se] simplest form of data categories, store directly into memory.

A Primitive is a Type of Data in Java language that is considered the simplest form of data. And, Primitive Data Types are so, simple that it is stored directly into memory. And, there are eight (8) Primitive Data Types in Java language are as follows:

1.            Boolean,
2.            Byte,
3.            Char,
4.            Double,
5.            Float,
6.            Integer,
7.            Long and 
8.            Short.

Therefore, after you have created a new variable of a Primitive Data Type such as, an Integer (int), the IntelliJ IDE Compiler will execute or run; in order to separate out a box in memory with an Integer (int) name, x assigned to the value of 3, as shown below:  

                                                                                               int x = 3;
                                                                                                      
The variable stores the actual data.
                                                                                                       x
                                                                                                    

“value is semantic”


So, whenever, you have passed an Integer (int) name x, assigned statement to the value of 3, you have passed an Integer (int) named x, as a Primitive Data Type that is assigned statement to the name, x which is, equal to the value of 3. And, when you are creating a brand-new version of your Primitive Data Types such as, an Integer (int) is known as, a value semantic and those Primitive Data Types are often referred to as value types. This is call, a value semantic because the Primitive Data Type, Integer (int) is the value semantic stored in the value of 3.

Value Semantics (Value Types) is a system in which values are stored directly and copying is achieved by creating independent copies of values. Types that use value semantics are called value types. (1)

Primitive Data Types are so simple, you can do direct mathematical operations on them with characters, as you are already familiar with using a calculator operations are as follows:

•             Additive Operators:
1.            Additions (+), and 
2.            Subtractions (-);
•             Multiplicative Operators:
1.            Multiplication (*),
2.            Division (/), and
3.            Modulus (%).

And, there are mathematical shortcuts that you can apply directly to a Primitive Data Types; in order to increase or decrease their values are as follows:

•             Unary Operators:
1.            ++;
2.            --;
3.            +, and
4.            -;
•             Assignment Operators:
1.            =,
2.            +=,
3.            -=,
4.            *=,
5.            /=, and
6.            %=.

Now, you know what a Primitive Data Types are than your next question, you should ask yourself is. What is an Object Data Types?

An Object Data Types are much more complicated than a Primitive Data Types because an Object Data Types stores data in a[n] object or element or the value is semantic from a variable which is, a value semantic in a Primitive Data Types stored, as a[n] reference semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing to a specific location at which the object or element or the value is semantic, is stored.  And, these Object Data Types methods acts on its data by ways of storing multiple pieces or related data information under a single reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing which, stores the object or element or the value is semantic, as a methods in Java language. However, please do not become intimidated by an Object Data Types because you have probably had been programmatically coding in Java language, Object Data Types, already.

Reference Semantics (Reference Types) is a system in which references to a values are stored and copying is achieved by copying these references. Types that use reference semantics are called reference types. (2)

               Hoboken: Pearson, 2019. Print. pp. 484-485.

In most Object Data Types from Java language rules have been explicitly or clearly constructed by calling a special method known as, a Constructor.

Constructor (Construct) is a special syntax used to create and initialize an object. Objects in Java programs must be constructed before they can be used. (3)

3 Reyes, Stuart and Stepp, Marty. “Reference Semantics.” Building Java Programs, A Back to Basics Approach 5e,
               Hoboken: Pearson, 2019. Print. pp. 173.

Constructors are:

1.            Strings,
2.            Arrays,
3.            Scanner, and 
4.            ArrayList.

And, these Constructors are all considered Object Data Types and, you should have noticed these Object Data Types always starts with a capital letter in your Java language codes and, I want to be extra clear on these Constructors’ rules for an Object Data Types.

When you are creating a variable for a new Constructor in an Array, Object Data Type for example, you first (1st) need to declare a variable for an Array of an Integer (int); therefore, you will have to know what value semantics or value types to use. And, your choice in a value semantics or value types will depend on the type of a[n] object or element or value is semantic, you want to have in your Array. In creating an Array Constructor, you must first (1st) assign a[n] Primitive or Object Data Type from a value semantic in your Java language codes follow by a set of open and close square brackets [ ]. For example, if you are storing Integer (int) values and, you want to achieve a sequence of a Primitive Data Type or value semantic, Integer (int); so, you will write, your Java language codes, as an int [ ]. Next, you will need to declare a variable by assigning a statement name, x for storing your object or element or the value is semantic in an Array is as follow:

int [] x;

An Arrays are objects or elements, or these values are semantic, which means, the[se] Arrays must be Constructed. In simply terms, declaring a variable is lacking adequate Java language rules; in order to bring a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic into existence. In this case, you want an Array Constructor with three (3) Integer (int) values are as follows:

int [] x = new int [3];
      
In the above example, you will noticed, on the left-hand side, you did not place any character[s] inside the open and close square brackets [ ] because you are describing a[n] Primitive or Object Data Type or value semantic in your Java language program.  And, the variable name, x is a[n] reference semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing to any Arrays of Integer (int) values, no matter how many objects or elements or these values are semantic it has, in an Array Constructor. Now, on the right-hand side, you will have to Java programmatic codes, a specific number of a[n] objects or elements or values are semantic because you are executing and running onto your IntelliJ IDE Compiler; in order to Construct an actual Array’s object or element or the value is semantic in these three (3) Integer (int) values. And, the Array Constructor need to know how many objects or elements, or these values are semantic to include in your Array.  

So, when an IntelliJ IDE Compiler executes a line of code to Construct, the Array Constructor of three (3) Integer (int) values, as shown below and, the variable name, x will reference semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing are copy to the variable name, x are equal to a[n] objects or elements, or values are semantic.

                                                                                                                 1         2        3

                                          x 
                                    


Therefore, you will always need to pay close attention to your actual copying of your reference semantics or indexes or zero-based indexing to an Array, Object Data Types itself because an Object Data Types are more complicated than a Primitive Data Types and, you will not be able to do simple additions or subtractions with an Object Data Types the way, you would with simple, Primitive Data Types’ operators. And, an Object Data Types comes with their own Constructors syntax behavior and, a lot of times, you will have to look at the methods or Constructors of an Object Data Types to know, what you can do with it. 

For example, if you want to know, how many characters are in a String, you will call the .length method is as follow:

or, if you want to write your Java program in a Scanner Constructor, Object Data Types; in order to provide your interactive users with the next number hint than you will need to write your Java language codes are as follows:


Each Object Data Types has their own set of behaviors such as, Methods and Constructors on which, you can independently look up using Java language library.

And, before, I dive much deeper into Object Data Types, I will need to discuss and explain one (1) more topic which is, 
a special keyword call Null.

Null is a Java keyword signifying “no object.” 

The concept of null doesn’t have any meaning for value types like int and double that store actual values.  But it can make sense to set a variable that stores a reference to null through auto-initialization.  This is a way of telling the computer that you want to have the variable, but you have not yet come up with an object to which it should refer. So, you can use null for variable of any object type, such as, a String or array:

String s = null;
Int [ ] list = null;  

There is a difference between setting a variable to an empty string and setting it to a null.  When you set a variable to an empty string, there is an actual object to which your variable refers (although not a very interesting object). When you set a variable to null, the variable does not yet refer to an actual object. If you try to use the variable to access the object when it has been set to a null, Java will throw a NullPointerExeception.  (4)

               Hoboken: Pearson, 2019. Print. pp. 488.


Null is only a word that literally means No Object and, a Null value of zero (0) is a[n] object or element or value is semantic which is assigned to a[n] reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing from the variable reference. In an Objects Data Type, Integer (int), you will need to programmatic code in a Java program, an assign value semantic to a variable reference; in order to give a Null value of zero (0) reference, as a[n] object or element or value is semantic. And, similarly, the same rule applies to Object Data Type, double, you will need to programmatic code in a Java program, an assign value semantic to a variable reference; in order to give a Null value of zero dot zero (0.0) reference, as a[n] object or element or value is semantic.

So, let us say, you are Java language coding a New Array of a String that is a Constructor for an Object Data Type and, you are coding your String, Object Data Type variable reference name, as strArray that is equal to a String values of Chars which are objects or elements or values are semantic and, creating a Constructor in order to specify, how many times, a new String should be executed in between a[n] open and close square brackets that you have assigned a value of five (5) reference, as a[n] reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing value in an Array, as follows:

String [] strArray = new String[5];


So, what does your Java language codes stores onto the IntelliJ IDE Compiler memory when you have coded a bunch of Strings?

Java String Array is used to hold fixed number of Strings. String Array is very common in simple java programs, specially, among beginners to java and to test some specific scenarios. Even java main method argument is string array – public static void main(String[] args). 

•             Java String Array is basically an array of objects.
•             There are two ways to declare String Array – declaration without size and declare with size.
•             There are two ways to initialize String Array – at the time of declaration, populating values after declaration.
•             We can do different kind of processing on string array such as iteration, sorting, searching etc.

Let’s go over java string array example programs now.

Java String Array Declaration
Below code snippet shows different ways for string array declaration in java.

String[] strArray; //declare without size

String [] strArray = new String[5]; //declare with size

Note that we can also write String Array, as String strArray[] but above shows the standard and recommended ways for Java language coding String Array. Also, in the above code, strArray is null whereas, strArray value is [null, null, null, null, null]. 

This is where Null comes in; in order to automatically fill in the new String[5] indexes.

strArray                                                           0                                  1                             2                            3                              4
Null        Null        Null        Null        Null


Null Pointer Exception:

strArray[0].length();

This is important to know because chances are, you will probably run into a very common type of exception while programming in Java language call, a Null Pointer Exception. And, a Null Pointer Exception happens when you had Java language coded, a Constructors to perform a method on an Object Data Type that is Null. In the above example, let say, you want to get the length of the String that is stored in the first (1st) index of the above Array (strArray[0].length()) example. And, if you noticed, in the above example there is no String in the first (1st) reference semantic or index or zero-based indexing value that gives a Null value of zero (0) reference, as a[n] object or element or value is semantic . Therefore, you will receive a Null Pointer Exception because you cannot call the length on a String, Object Data Type that does not exist.

And, keep in mind that a Null means no object not empty object.

“ “ means not Null.

“”.length() = 0; means, you can call a .length on an empty String when the length is zero (0) index; however, there is no such String as length, as shown in the above example.

And, chances are, you will get plenty of practice with Null when you are Java language coding onto your IntelliJ IDE Compiler by ways of encountering errors along the way.  And, again, it is important to remember that Null means no object. So, if you are missing any Object Data Types in your Java language programs then you will need to Java code an Object Data Types into your codes. (5)
