So, up until now, we have been storing our Variables independent from one (1) another. And, a Variable is sometimes complicated; if these Variables are themselves an Object Data Types in Java language. Therefore, I am sure, you have discovered in our prior online tutorial lesson, ultimately not one (1) Variables were really associated with one (1) another.  

An Object are entities that contains state (data) and behavior (methods)  (1)

In the below example, let us say, we have a Variable which is an Object Data Type, Integer (int) and we are asking our interactive user, how many in, Integer (int) of a value is in an item number[s]. So, we have written, our Java code in order to separate our Variable from other Variables for our interactive user response. We have intentionally Java coded, our Variables in separations from each other.  Now, we are Java programmatically responsible in writing our Java File Programs; in order to associate our Variables to one (1) another.

Variables:

int howMany = 0;
String userResponse = input.next();

And, as you can imagine, over time when you have written numerous of Java’s Variables known as, Class Objects which are associated with one (1) another in your first (1st) Class Objects, Java File Program than you might want to actually Java code a Constructor (new) also known as, Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance in another Java File Program which is reference from or method call, your Variables from your Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program. In order to physically link your Variables knowns as, State [Data] that is passed or flowed into your Instance Header Method in order for you to create an Instance Methods’ Objects which interacts with your Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program. Especially, when you want to have numerous of associated Variables, known as, Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes [State] and Instance Methods. Therefore, you will need to Java code an Object, Data Types; in order to accomplish your Variables known as, State [Data] and Instance Methods which associates them to one (1) another.    

Let us take the below example of an academic student who has personal identifiers’ information (PII) associated to his or her educational attainments in which, he or she will need to know specified information while attending an educational institution requesting on his or her academic profile. As, you are writing your Java File Programs, you will need to know these students’ full legal names, Identification (ID) numbers, class schedules, Grade Point Average (GPA) and, etc. All students’ academic PIIs are associated onto how he or she had academically performed while attending an educational institutions. And, there are numerous of different students with individual academic PII associated to them and, you will have to write, your Java codes which contains a[n] individual students’ full legal names, Identification (ID) numbers, class schedules, Grade Point Average (GPA) and, etc in accordance to the Object Oriented Programming in Java language.  In the below example is a Java File Programs, Static Header Method highlighted in orange color; in order to illustrate two (2) students with their own individuals’ Variables known as, State [Data] and Instance Methods associated to them.

Let us imagine, if you are a Developer for an educational institution with thousands of students attendees, post-graduations and, a students who[m] did not finish their educational attainments due from working overtime, academic fallacies, transferring (meaning students loses credits) to another educational institutions and veering off course (from his or her academic studies). And, how would you, as a Developer manage all of these Variables known as, State [Data] and Instance Methods associated with thousands of individual students?

Well, what you can do, as a Developer is, you can write, your own Java code Variables known as, State [Data] and Instance Methods within your Class Objects, Java File Program as follows:















In the below example, we have reconstructed, our very own Class Objects, Java File Program name, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java that interacts with the Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program name, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectOnlineNoteExample1App.java Objects’ Constructors as follows: 











What we have done thus far, we have Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java, as a Class Objects, in order to serves as a blueprint for our Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance’s new keyword in a separate Java File Program name, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectOnlineNoteExample1App.java which interacts with our Class Objects’ Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java.

In order to create or Java code, a new type of Objects’ Constructor, we must create a Class and add code to the new type of Objects’ Constructor which specifies the following elements:

•             the state stored in each Object,
•             the behavior each Object can perform, and
•             how to construct Object of that type.

And, once we have written the appropriate code, we can use the Class Object; in order to create an Objects of a new Constructor types. (2)

In the above example, you will notice, our Class Objects’ Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java that 
does not contain any Static Header Method only contain State [Data] and Instance Methods within the Class Header Method and, we will have to initializes each special variables inside the Class Objects’ call Fields which is also known as, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes. These Class Objects’ Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes are just a list of half incomplete Variables without any associated values.  In until, we pass or flow those Class Objects’ Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes into our Instance Header Method; in order to declare them as, a State [Data] and Instance Methods within our Class Header Method.

Field is a variable inside a class object that makes up part of its internal user.

The syntax for declaring a field is the same as the syntax for declaring normal variables:

•             a type followed by a name and a semicolon (;).


However, unlike normal Variables, fields are declared directly inside the Class Header Method open and close curly braces. And, when we had declared a field, we are saying that we want every object of this Class Object to have that variable inside it.  (3)

               Hoboken: Pearson, 2019. Print. pp. 541-543.


After, we have Java coded our State [Data] and Instance Methods in our Class Objects’ Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java then we can method call or interact with those Class Objects’ State [Data] and Instance Methods onto our Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectOnlineNoteExample1App.java in order to create a Constructor new keyword. Now, our Class Objects name is Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1 followed by an assigned Variable name, Student1 that is equal to a new (Constructor Keyword) followed by the (Class Objects name) Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1 followed by a[n] open and close parentheses that stores our State [Data] and Instance Methods parameters as a[n] reference semantic, indices or zero-based indexing numbers within our assigned Variable name, Student1.

In the above example, we have two (2) students (Suzy, and Holly) whom academic PIIs are well packaged or stored within their own single Variable names.  And, those single Variable names are method call or interacts with our Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectOnlineNoteExample1App.java. 

What is an Object, State and Behavior?  

An Object is a programming entity or a Java File Progam that contains state (data) and behavior (methods).

State is a set of values (internal data) stored in a class object.

Behavior is a set of actions a class object can perform, often reporting and or modifying its internal state.  (4)

So, in our above example, our State is all Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes which stores a specific information about any students’ PIIs such as, a students’ first name, last name, identification (ID) number, course major, grade point average, absentee and, whether or not a student is on an academic probation. And, our Behaviors are our Java codes set to a specified actions onto an Instance Methods within our Instance Header Method. Therefore, within our Java codes, we can manage our academic students’ PIIs such as, an administrator who needs to know a student’s graduation year or help a student change courses or help a student who need a copy of his or her educational institution transcript. All our State [Data] and Instance Methods requires an academic students’ PIIs to be method call or interacts with our Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance from the Class Objects’ Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java within the Class Header Method.
Surprise, you have been Java programmatically coding using Class Objects all along. I am sure, you have heard, us use this phrase before.  In other words, all of your Class Objects, you have been Java coding were created in these manners, we have taught you thus far. For example, a String Object Data Types are a Class Objects known as State within the Class Header Method is a set of value stored in whatever character, you have stung together as follows:

Strings
•             Store the collection of characters.
•             Has .equals() method to compares two (2) Strings.
•             Has .length() method to return how many characters are currently being stored inside a[n] Objects, Elements or values are semantic.

In a dot equal (.equal) method is a Behavior in which, you have Java coded to act onto two (2) separate String Objects, as an Instance method and, whenever you call a new Objects’ Constructor, you will create a different version onto that stream Class Object with the same State. Even though, the String’ Objects has a different values; however, those String Objects can be used for the same Behavior in which, you have learned in all Strings methods had been extremely useful in learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java language. 

String firstName;

Let us take a look at our above Class Objects’ Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java in our first (1st) step that gives us an Object Data Types followed by an assigned names and a semicolons (;) are known as, Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes which is contain in a State that is initialized within the Class Header Method. 

this.firstName = firstName;

And, our State is pass or flow or stream into the Instance Header Method in our second (2nd) step where we add in our Instance Methods which represents their Behaviors set to our Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes that performed an actions and contains both State and Behavior in our Class Object’s Java File Program, Module2WritingYourOwnObjectsOnlineNoteExample1.java.  For example, a String Object has a dot length (.length) and a Scanner Object has a dot nextInt (.nextInt) which are Instance Methods.

In the above example, we think of these Instance Methods, as being operates inside our Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes in which, you have Java coded, your Instance Methods’ names followed by a dot (.) followed by a[n] Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes’ names that is equal to your Objects, Elements and the Values are Semantic followed by a semicolons (;). Please keep in mind, in each Instance Methods’ names are able to interact, as a normal Variables with these State [Data] stored inside a[n] Fields, Instance Variables, Data Members or Attributes which are declared within the Instance Header Method.

So, let us say, in the below example, how do we get your Class Object to run? 

After, you have realized in your Class Objects, you do not have the Main Header Method in which, you know already that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or IDE Compiler looks for the Main Header Method after the start of the Class Header Method. And, when you try to run your Class Objects, Java File Program, you will probably receive a Java error code which says, “no executable found.” And, your Java error code happens because your Class Objects, Java File Program, must always pair with your Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program in Behavior from your Constructor Keywords that is executable.  

What is a Client (or Client Code)?

Client is an Objects’ Constructor code, Java File Program that interacts with a Class Objects, Java File Program.

Client programs,  Objects’ Constructor codes, Java File Program interacts with the Class Objects, Java File Program by sending messages to the Objects’ Constructor, Java File Program and asking them to perform a specific Behaviors. A major benefit of a Class Objects, Java File Program are they provide reusable pieces of codes that can be used in many Client programs.  (5)

This is how, you can adapt your written Java codes to fit your personal programmatic needs; in order to simplify your complexity in organizing your State [Data] with all types of Instance Methods in your Class Objects, Java File Program. If you think about your reconstructions of your special Variables in the contexts of Class Objects, Java File Program, you will eventually realizes your Class Objects, Java File Program can be written more in an advance then an normal Variables. Now, sometimes your comprehension towards understanding these differences between a[n] Class Objects, Java File Program and Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program can become discombobulating for beginning Developers from this online tutorial course in the Object Oriented Programming in Java. However, do not worry yourselves, as you practice more, you will understand exactly what a Class Objects, Java File Program does and how an Object Constructor, Client or Object Instance, Java File Program put a[n] State [Data] and Instance Methods to best use.
